# PostgreSQL Views - In-Depth Guide

## Overview

A **view** in PostgreSQL is a virtual table based on the result of a `SELECT` query. Unlike regular tables, views do not store data themselves but provide a way to encapsulate complex queries for reusability, security, and abstraction.

## What is a View?

A **view** is a named SQL query stored in the database schema. When you query a view, PostgreSQL runs the underlying SQL every time, returning up-to-date results.

Views are useful for:
- Abstracting complex joins and logic
- Providing specific data subsets
- Controlling access (security barrier views)

---

## Creating a View

Basic syntax:

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW active_customers AS
SELECT id, name, email
FROM customers
WHERE status = 'active';
```

To list all views in the current schema:

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.views
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

---

## Querying a View

```sql
SELECT * FROM active_customers;
```

You can use filters, joins, or aggregations just like with regular tables.

---

## Updating Data through Views

PostgreSQL allows updating base tables through views **only if**:
- The view is simple (selects from a single table)
- It doesn’t use aggregation, grouping, joins, DISTINCT, LIMIT, OFFSET, etc.

Example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW simple_view AS
SELECT id, name FROM users;

UPDATE simple_view SET name = 'New Name' WHERE id = 1;
```

If you need more control, define **INSTEAD OF triggers**:

```sql
CREATE VIEW user_view AS
SELECT id, name FROM users;

CREATE FUNCTION update_user_view() RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE users SET name = NEW.name WHERE id = NEW.id;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER user_view_trigger
INSTEAD OF UPDATE ON user_view
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_user_view();
```

---

## Materialized Views

A **materialized view** is like a snapshot — it stores the result of a query physically and can be refreshed manually.

Syntax:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mat_view AS
SELECT * FROM large_table
WITH DATA;
```

To refresh:

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mat_view;
```

Use when:
- Query is expensive
- You don’t need real-time updates

You can also use `WITH NO DATA` and `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` later.

## View vs Materialized View

| Feature                | View                       | Materialized View         |
|------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Storage                | No                         | Yes                        |
| Real-time data         | Yes                        | No (until refreshed)       |
| Performance            | Slower on large queries    | Faster (cached results)    |
| Updatable              | Sometimes                  | No                         |
| Refresh Required       | No                         | Yes                        |

## Performance Considerations

- Views add **no performance gain** on their own — they’re just query wrappers.
- Complex views can hinder performance if nested too deeply or used inefficiently.
- Materialized views **do improve performance** by avoiding repeated computation.
- Ensure indexes exist on base tables to optimize views.

---

## Use Cases

- Abstract business logic into reusable layers
- Enforce access control (hide sensitive columns)
- Predefine filtered/aggregated subsets of data
- Reduce complexity in client applications
- Provide legacy compatibility interfaces

---

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names for views
- Avoid using views inside views inside views (view nesting) — can become unreadable and slow
- Document view logic in comments
- Use materialized views for expensive queries
- Avoid updating data via views unless absolutely necessary

---

## Limitations

- Views cannot contain parameters (use functions instead)
- Cannot define indexes directly on views (except materialized views)
- Updating data via views has strict requirements or needs triggers
- Recursive or deeply nested views can confuse query planners

## Summary

PostgreSQL views are powerful tools for data abstraction, security, and simplification. Use them wisely to make SQL more maintainable, but be aware of their performance and update limitations.

Choose:
- **Views** for logical abstraction and security
- **Materialized views** for performance and precomputed results
