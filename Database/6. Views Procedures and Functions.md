# PostgreSQL Views, Procedures & Functions - Interview Notes

## 1. VIEWS

### Theory

A **View** is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL statement. It contains rows and columns just like a real table, but doesn't store data physically. Views are stored queries that can be treated like tables.

### Types of Views

- **Simple Views**: Based on single table
- **Complex Views**: Based on multiple tables with joins, aggregations
- **Materialized Views**: Physically store the result set (PostgreSQL specific)

### Syntax

```sql
-- Create View
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

-- Drop View
DROP VIEW view_name;

-- Update View
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT ...;
```

### Simple Example

```sql
-- Sample Tables
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary NUMERIC(10,2),
    hire_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE departments (
    dept_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    manager_id INTEGER
);

-- Simple View
CREATE VIEW high_earners AS
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;

-- Complex View with JOIN
CREATE VIEW employee_dept_info AS
SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.dept_name, d.manager_id
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department = d.dept_name;

-- Using the View
SELECT * FROM high_earners;
```

### Use Cases

- **Data Security**: Hide sensitive columns from certain users
- **Simplification**: Simplify complex queries for end users
- **Data Abstraction**: Present data in different formats
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain old table structure after schema changes

### Limitations

- Cannot always be updated (depends on complexity)
- Performance overhead for complex views
- No indexes (except materialized views)

## 2. STORED PROCEDURES

### Theory

A **Stored Procedure** is a prepared SQL code that can be saved and reused. It's a set of SQL statements with optional control-of-flow statements, stored in the database and executed as a unit.
### Key Features

- Can have input/output parameters
- Can contain business logic
- Can perform transactions
- Can call other procedures/functions
- **Cannot return values directly** (use OUT parameters)

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE procedure_name(
    parameter_name parameter_type [IN | OUT | INOUT]
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Procedure body
END;
$$;

-- Call Procedure
CALL procedure_name(parameter_values);
```

### Examples

```sql
-- Simple Procedure with IN parameter
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE increase_salary(
    emp_id INTEGER,
    raise_amount NUMERIC
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE employees 
    SET salary = salary + raise_amount
    WHERE id = emp_id;
    
    -- Log the change
    INSERT INTO salary_log(employee_id, old_salary, new_salary, change_date)
    VALUES (emp_id, 
            (SELECT salary - raise_amount FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id),
            (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id),
            CURRENT_DATE);
END;
$$;

-- Procedure with OUT parameter
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE get_employee_count(
    dept_name VARCHAR,
    OUT emp_count INTEGER
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO emp_count
    FROM employees
    WHERE department = dept_name;
END;
$$;

-- Calling procedures
CALL increase_salary(1, 5000);
CALL get_employee_count('IT', NULL);  -- OUT parameter
```

### Use Cases

- **Complex Business Logic**: Multi-step operations
- **Data Validation**: Before insert/update operations
- **Batch Processing**: Bulk data operations
- **Transaction Management**: Ensure data consistency
- **Security**: Controlled data access

## 3. FUNCTIONS

### Theory

A **Function** is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task and **returns a value**. Functions are more flexible than procedures and can be used in SQL expressions.

### Types of Functions

- **Scalar Functions**: Return single value
- **Table Functions**: Return table/result set
- **Aggregate Functions**: Work with groups of rows

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_name(
    parameter_name parameter_type
)
RETURNS return_type
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Function body
    RETURN value;
END;
$$;
```

### Examples

```sql
-- Scalar Function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_bonus(
    emp_salary NUMERIC,
    performance_rating INTEGER
)
RETURNS NUMERIC
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    CASE performance_rating
        WHEN 5 THEN RETURN emp_salary * 0.15;  -- 15% bonus
        WHEN 4 THEN RETURN emp_salary * 0.10;  -- 10% bonus
        WHEN 3 THEN RETURN emp_salary * 0.05;  -- 5% bonus
        ELSE RETURN 0;
    END CASE;
END;
$$;

-- Table Function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_employees_by_dept(dept_name VARCHAR)
RETURNS TABLE(
    employee_name VARCHAR,
    employee_salary NUMERIC,
    hire_date DATE
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT name, salary, employees.hire_date
    FROM employees
    WHERE department = dept_name
    ORDER BY salary DESC;
END;
$$;

-- Using Functions
SELECT name, salary, calculate_bonus(salary, 4) as bonus
FROM employees;

SELECT * FROM get_employees_by_dept('IT');
```

### Use Cases

- **Calculations**: Complex mathematical operations
- **Data Transformation**: Format or convert data
- **Reusable Logic**: Common operations across queries
- **Custom Aggregations**: Specialized grouping operations

## COMMON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

### Views Questions:

1. **What is the difference between a view and a table?**
    
    - Views are virtual tables, don't store data physically
    - Tables store actual data on disk
2. **Can you update data through a view?**
    
    - Simple views: Usually yes
    - Complex views (with JOINs, GROUP BY): Usually no
    - Depends on PostgreSQL's updatable view rules
3. **What are materialized views?**
    
    - Views that physically store the result set
    - Need to be refreshed manually: `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name`
    - Better performance but uses storage space

### Procedures Questions:

1. **How do you return values from a procedure?**
    
    - Use OUT or INOUT parameters
    - Cannot use RETURN statement like functions
2. **Can procedures be used in SELECT statements?**
    
    - No, they must be called using CALL statement
3. **What's the difference between stored procedure and function?**
    
    - Procedures don't return values directly
    - Functions always return a value
    - Functions can be used in expressions

### Functions Questions:

1. **What are the different types of functions in PostgreSQL?**
    
    - Scalar, Table-valued, Aggregate functions
    - Built-in vs User-defined functions
2. **Can functions modify data?**
    
    - Yes, but it's not recommended
    - Functions should be "pure" (no side effects)
    - Use procedures for data modification
3. **What is a table function?**
    
    - Function that returns a table/result set
    - Can be used in FROM clause like a table
