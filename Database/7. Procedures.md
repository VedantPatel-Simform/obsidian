# PostgreSQL Procedures - Complete Guide

## 📘 Overview

In PostgreSQL, **procedures** are routines stored in the database that **encapsulate business logic** and **support transactional control**. Unlike functions, procedures can commit or roll back transactions — making them essential for complex workflows in enterprise-grade applications.

> Introduced in PostgreSQL 11, procedures are distinct from functions in behavior and use cases.
## 📌 What are Procedures?

A **procedure** is a stored block of code in the PostgreSQL server that performs operations, often with **transaction control**. Unlike functions, they are invoked with `CALL` and **cannot return values directly**.

## 🔧 Syntax

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (
    [ IN | OUT | INOUT ] parameter_name data_type,
    ...
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    -- procedural logic
END;
$$;
```

---

## ▶️ Calling a Procedure

Procedures are called using the `CALL` statement:

```sql
CALL procedure_name(arg1, arg2, ...);
```

If parameters are declared as `OUT` or `INOUT`, the result can be seen using anonymous code blocks.

## ⚖️ Procedure vs Function

| Feature                   | Function                     | Procedure                    |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Call syntax               | `SELECT my_func()`           | `CALL my_proc()`             |
| Returns value             | Yes                          | No (only OUT/INOUT params)   |
| Transaction control       | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes                        |
| Side effects              | Generally avoided            | Common and intended          |
| Triggers support          | ✅ Yes                        | ❌ No                         |
| Used in queries           | ✅ Yes                        | ❌ No                         |

## 🔄 Transaction Control

One of the **biggest features** of procedures is **transaction management**.

You can use:

```sql
COMMIT;
ROLLBACK;
SAVEPOINT name;
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT name;
```

🔒 Example:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE transfer_money(sender INT, receiver INT, amount NUMERIC)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - amount WHERE id = sender;
    SAVEPOINT after_debit;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + amount WHERE id = receiver;

    -- rollback to savepoint if receiver doesn't exist
    IF NOT FOUND THEN
        ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT after_debit;
    END IF;

    COMMIT;
END;
$$;
```

---

## 🎛 Parameter Modes

Procedures support three types of parameters:

- `IN` (default): Input only
- `OUT`: Output only
- `INOUT`: Input and output

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE greet_user(IN name TEXT, OUT greeting TEXT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    greeting := 'Hello, ' || name || '!';
END;
$$;
```

---

## 🗣 Language Options

You can write procedures in:

- `plpgsql` (most common)
- `SQL` (for simple procedural SQL logic)
- `C`, `Python`, `JavaScript` (with extensions like PL/Python)

Example in SQL:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE simple_add(IN a INT, IN b INT, OUT sum INT)
LANGUAGE SQL
AS $$
    SELECT a + b INTO sum;
$$;
```

---

## 🧪 Examples

### 1. Basic Procedure

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE log_activity(user_id INT, activity TEXT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO activity_log(user_id, activity, log_time)
    VALUES (user_id, activity, NOW());
END;
$$;
```

### 2. Procedure with INOUT

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE increment(INOUT counter INT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    counter := counter + 1;
END;
$$;
```

---

## 🔍 Advanced Concepts

### ✔ Exception Handling

```sql
BEGIN
    -- statements
EXCEPTION
    WHEN division_by_zero THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Cannot divide by zero.';
        ROLLBACK;
END;
```

### ✔ Dynamic SQL with `EXECUTE`

```sql
EXECUTE format('UPDATE %I SET value = %L WHERE id = %s', table_name, new_val, rec_id);
```

### ✔ Temporary Table Usage

Procedures can create, use, and drop temp tables across commits.

## 🧭 Use Cases

- Complex multi-step transactions
- Batch processing
- Administrative tasks (e.g., scheduled cleanups)
- ETL workflows
- Logging and auditing
- Account or inventory reconciliation

---

## 🧼 Best Practices

- Keep logic modular and small
- Avoid unnecessary commits inside a procedure
- Log failures in `EXCEPTION` blocks
- Use `INOUT`/`OUT` wisely to return status or results
- Name procedures clearly: `process_`, `update_`, `cleanup_`, etc.
- Avoid mixing procedure logic with triggers or query functions

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- No return value via `RETURN` (only through `OUT` params)
- Can't be called directly from a query (unlike functions)
- Cannot be used in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, or joins
- Cannot be used in triggers

## ✅ Summary

PostgreSQL **procedures** offer an enterprise-level way to manage complex, stateful database workflows. Unlike functions, procedures are capable of **committing or rolling back transactions**, making them a powerful tool for database developers and DBAs alike.

Use them when:
- You need full control over transactions
- You're doing batch or administrative operations
- You want to encapsulate logic with side effects (e.g., logs, updates)
