# PostgreSQL CTEs (Common Table Expressions) - Complete Guide

## 📘 Overview

A **Common Table Expression (CTE)** in PostgreSQL is a temporary result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. CTEs improve readability, modularize queries, and enable recursion.

> Introduced in PostgreSQL 8.4, CTEs are powerful tools for complex data processing and hierarchical queries.
## 📌 What is a CTE?

A CTE acts like a **temporary named result set** that exists only during the execution of a SQL statement. It helps break complex queries into readable and maintainable parts.

## 🔧 CTE Syntax

```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
    SELECT ...
)
SELECT ...
FROM cte_name;
```

---

## 🧪 Simple CTE Example

```sql
WITH recent_orders AS (
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
)
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) FROM recent_orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

---

## ➕ Using Multiple CTEs

```sql
WITH sales AS (
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'completed'
),
returns AS (
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'returned'
)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales
UNION
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM returns;
```

Each CTE can build upon previous ones.

## 🔁 Recursive CTEs

Used to deal with **hierarchical** or **tree-structured data** like org charts, category trees, etc.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE subordinates AS (
    SELECT id, manager_id, name FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.id, e.manager_id, e.name
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN subordinates s ON e.manager_id = s.id
)
SELECT * FROM subordinates;
```

## ✍️ CTEs in DML

### Insert:

```sql
WITH new_users AS (
    SELECT * FROM staging_users WHERE signup_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
)
INSERT INTO users (name, email)
SELECT name, email FROM new_users;
```

### Update:

```sql
WITH recent_activity AS (
    SELECT user_id FROM logins WHERE login_time > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
)
UPDATE users
SET status = 'active'
WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM recent_activity);
```

### Delete:

```sql
WITH old_logs AS (
    SELECT id FROM logs WHERE created_at < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
)
DELETE FROM logs WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM old_logs);
```

## ⚖️ CTE vs Subquery

| Feature       | CTE                                | Subquery                            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Readability   | High - logically separated parts    | Medium - nested logic                |
| Reusability   | Yes (across query)                 | No                                   |
| Recursion     | ✅ Yes                              | ❌ No                                |
| Performance   | Can be optimized (inline)           | Often more performant for simple ops|

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

- PostgreSQL **inlines** non-recursive CTEs since v12 → improves performance.
- Be cautious with large CTE chains in recursive queries.
- Avoid materialized CTEs if not needed; they prevent some optimizations.

---

## 🧭 Use Cases

- Improving query readability
- Recursive relationships (trees, graphs)
- Modularizing large queries
- Performing DML based on filtered data
- Debugging complex joins

---

## 🧼 Best Practices

- Use descriptive CTE names
- Avoid deeply nested recursion (limit depth)
- Use only when it aids clarity or reuse
- Prefer CTEs over repeated subqueries for readability

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Cannot use CTEs across multiple SQL statements (not persistent)
- Recursive CTEs can lead to performance issues if not limited
- Not always the best for performance (benchmark!)

## ✅ Summary

CTEs are an essential tool in PostgreSQL for writing **clean, modular, and recursive queries**. They're especially useful in reporting, hierarchies, and data transformations.

Use them when:
- You want readable and maintainable code
- You need recursion
- You need to reuse subqueries across a complex statement
