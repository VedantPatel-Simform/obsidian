# PostgreSQL DML Commands - Complete Guide

## What is DML?

Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands manipulate data within tables:

- INSERT - adds new data
- SELECT - retrieves data
- UPDATE - modifies existing data
- DELETE - removes data

## INSERT Command

### Basic INSERT

```sql
-- Insert single row
INSERT INTO employees (name, email, salary, department_id)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@company.com', 50000, 1);

-- Insert multiple rows
INSERT INTO employees (name, email, salary, department_id)
VALUES 
    ('Jane Smith', 'jane@company.com', 55000, 2),
    ('Bob Johnson', 'bob@company.com', 48000, 1),
    ('Alice Brown', 'alice@company.com', 62000, 3);
```

### INSERT with Column Selection

```sql
-- Insert with specific columns only
INSERT INTO employees (name, email)
VALUES ('Tom Wilson', 'tom@company.com');

-- Other columns get default values or NULL
```

### INSERT with DEFAULT values

```sql
-- Use DEFAULT keyword
INSERT INTO employees (name, email, salary, hire_date)
VALUES ('Sarah Davis', 'sarah@company.com', DEFAULT, DEFAULT);

-- Skip columns for defaults
INSERT INTO employees (name, email)
VALUES ('Mike Chen', 'mike@company.com');
```

### INSERT from SELECT

```sql
-- Insert data from another table
INSERT INTO employees_backup (name, email, salary)
SELECT name, email, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 1;

-- Insert with transformation
INSERT INTO employee_summary (full_name, annual_salary)
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name), salary * 12
FROM employees;
```

### INSERT with RETURNING

```sql
-- Return inserted data
INSERT INTO employees (name, email, salary)
VALUES ('Lisa Wang', 'lisa@company.com', 58000)
RETURNING id, name, created_at;

-- Return multiple rows
INSERT INTO products (name, price)
VALUES 
    ('Product A', 29.99),
    ('Product B', 39.99)
RETURNING id, name, price;
```

### INSERT with ON CONFLICT (UPSERT)

```sql
-- Do nothing on conflict
INSERT INTO employees (email, name, salary)
VALUES ('john@company.com', 'John Updated', 55000)
ON CONFLICT (email) DO NOTHING;

-- Update on conflict
INSERT INTO employees (email, name, salary)
VALUES ('john@company.com', 'John Updated', 55000)
ON CONFLICT (email) 
DO UPDATE SET 
    name = EXCLUDED.name,
    salary = EXCLUDED.salary,
    updated_at = NOW();

-- Complex conflict resolution
INSERT INTO product_inventory (product_id, quantity)
VALUES (1, 100)
ON CONFLICT (product_id)
DO UPDATE SET 
    quantity = product_inventory.quantity + EXCLUDED.quantity,
    last_updated = NOW()
WHERE product_inventory.quantity > 0;
```

## SELECT Command

### Basic SELECT

```sql
-- Select all columns
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Select specific columns
SELECT name, email, salary FROM employees;

-- Select with alias
SELECT 
    name AS full_name,
    email AS email_address,
    salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM employees;
```

### WHERE Clause

```sql
-- Basic conditions
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = 'John Doe';

-- Multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 45000 AND department_id IN (1, 2);

SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 60000;

-- Pattern matching
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE email LIKE '%@company.com';
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name ILIKE 'john%'; -- case insensitive

-- NULL checks
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE phone IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;

-- Array operations
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE skills @> ARRAY['SQL'];
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 'Python' = ANY(skills);
```

### ORDER BY

```sql
-- Single column sort
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY name ASC; -- ASC is default

-- Multiple column sort
SELECT * FROM employees 
ORDER BY department_id ASC, salary DESC;

-- Sort by expression
SELECT name, salary FROM employees 
ORDER BY salary * 12 DESC;

-- Sort with NULL handling
SELECT * FROM employees 
ORDER BY phone NULLS LAST;
```

### LIMIT and OFFSET

```sql
-- Limit results
SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10;

-- Pagination
SELECT * FROM employees 
ORDER BY id 
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20; -- Skip first 20, get next 10

-- Top N per group
SELECT DISTINCT ON (department_id) 
    department_id, name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY department_id, salary DESC;
```

### Aggregate Functions

```sql
-- Basic aggregates
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
SELECT COUNT(phone) FROM employees; -- excludes NULLs
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
SELECT MIN(salary), MAX(salary) FROM employees;

-- String aggregation
SELECT STRING_AGG(name, ', ') FROM employees;
SELECT ARRAY_AGG(name) FROM employees;
```

### GROUP BY and HAVING

```sql
-- Group by single column
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*), AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;

-- Group by multiple columns
SELECT department_id, hire_year, COUNT(*)
FROM (
    SELECT department_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date) as hire_year
    FROM employees
) sub
GROUP BY department_id, hire_year;

-- Having clause (filter groups)
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;

-- Complex grouping
SELECT 
    department_id,
    COUNT(*) as employee_count,
    AVG(salary) as avg_salary,
    MIN(hire_date) as first_hire
FROM employees
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

### Window Functions

```sql
-- Row number
SELECT name, salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank
FROM employees;

-- Partition by department
SELECT name, department_id, salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as dept_rank
FROM employees;

-- Running totals
SELECT name, salary,
    SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) as running_total
FROM employees;

-- Lead/Lag
SELECT name, salary,
    LAG(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) as prev_salary,
    LEAD(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) as next_salary
FROM employees;
```

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

```sql
-- Basic CTE
WITH high_earners AS (
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 60000
)
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
FROM high_earners
GROUP BY department_id;

-- Recursive CTE
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: top-level managers
    SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 as level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy ORDER BY level, name;
```

## UPDATE Command

### Basic UPDATE

```sql
-- Update single column
UPDATE employees 
SET salary = 55000 
WHERE id = 1;

-- Update multiple columns
UPDATE employees 
SET 
    salary = 58000,
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```

### UPDATE with Conditions

```sql
-- Conditional updates
UPDATE employees 
SET salary = salary * 1.1 
WHERE performance_rating = 'excellent';

-- Update based on other tables
UPDATE employees 
SET department_name = d.name
FROM departments d
WHERE employees.department_id = d.id;

-- Complex conditions
UPDATE products 
SET 
    price = CASE 
        WHEN category = 'electronics' THEN price * 1.1
        WHEN category = 'clothing' THEN price * 1.05
        ELSE price
    END,
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE last_updated < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### UPDATE with Subqueries

```sql
-- Update using subquery
UPDATE employees 
SET salary = (
    SELECT AVG(salary) 
    FROM employees e2 
    WHERE e2.department_id = employees.department_id
)
WHERE salary IS NULL;

-- Update with EXISTS
UPDATE employees 
SET bonus = salary * 0.1
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sales 
    WHERE salesperson_id = employees.id 
    AND sale_date >= '2024-01-01'
);
```

### UPDATE with RETURNING

```sql
-- Return updated rows
UPDATE employees 
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE department_id = 1
RETURNING id, name, salary;

-- Use returned values
WITH updated_employees AS (
    UPDATE employees 
    SET salary = salary * 1.1
    WHERE performance_rating = 'excellent'
    RETURNING id, name, salary
)
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(salary) FROM updated_employees;
```

### UPDATE with FROM clause

```sql
-- Update from another table
UPDATE employees 
SET salary = bonus_data.new_salary
FROM (
    VALUES 
        (1, 60000),
        (2, 65000),
        (3, 58000)
) AS bonus_data(emp_id, new_salary)
WHERE employees.id = bonus_data.emp_id;

-- Update with JOIN
UPDATE order_items 
SET total_price = oi.quantity * p.current_price
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE order_items.id = oi.id
  AND order_items.total_price != oi.quantity * p.current_price;
```

## DELETE Command

### Basic DELETE

```sql
-- Delete specific rows
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;

-- Delete with conditions
DELETE FROM employees 
WHERE hire_date < '2020-01-01' AND status = 'inactive';

-- Delete all rows (keep table structure)
DELETE FROM temp_data;
```

### DELETE with Subqueries

```sql
-- Delete using subquery
DELETE FROM employees 
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Temp Department'
);

-- Delete with EXISTS
DELETE FROM orders 
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM customers 
    WHERE customers.id = orders.customer_id 
    AND customers.status = 'inactive'
);

-- Delete duplicates
DELETE FROM employees e1
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM employees e2
    WHERE e2.email = e1.email 
    AND e2.id > e1.id
);
```

### DELETE with USING clause

```sql
-- Delete using another table
DELETE FROM order_items 
USING orders 
WHERE order_items.order_id = orders.id 
  AND orders.status = 'cancelled';

-- Complex delete with multiple tables
DELETE FROM employees 
USING departments, locations
WHERE employees.department_id = departments.id
  AND departments.location_id = locations.id
  AND locations.country = 'US'
  AND employees.status = 'inactive';
```

### DELETE with RETURNING

```sql
-- Return deleted rows
DELETE FROM employees 
WHERE salary < 30000
RETURNING id, name, salary;

-- Use for audit
INSERT INTO deleted_employees (original_id, name, deleted_at)
SELECT id, name, NOW()
FROM (
    DELETE FROM employees 
    WHERE last_login < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years'
    RETURNING id, name
) deleted_rows;
```

## Advanced DML Techniques

### Batch Operations

```sql
-- Batch insert with VALUES
INSERT INTO products (name, price, category)
VALUES 
    ('Product 1', 19.99, 'A'),
    ('Product 2', 29.99, 'B'),
    ('Product 3', 39.99, 'A'),
    ('Product 4', 49.99, 'C');

-- Batch update
UPDATE products 
SET price = CASE id
    WHEN 1 THEN 21.99
    WHEN 2 THEN 31.99
    WHEN 3 THEN 41.99
    ELSE price
END
WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3);
```

### Transaction Control

```sql
-- Explicit transaction
BEGIN;
    INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, total) VALUES (1, 100.00);
    UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 1 WHERE product_id = 1;
    INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity) 
    VALUES (currval('orders_id_seq'), 1, 1);
COMMIT;

-- Rollback on error
BEGIN;
    DELETE FROM old_records WHERE created_at < '2020-01-01';
    -- If something goes wrong:
    -- ROLLBACK;
COMMIT;
```

### Performance Tips

```sql
-- Use indexes for WHERE clauses
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_department ON employees(department_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_salary ON employees(salary);

-- Batch operations instead of row-by-row
-- Good:
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE department_id = 1;

-- Avoid:
-- UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE id = 1;
-- UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE id = 2;
-- ... (repeated for each row)

-- Use LIMIT for large deletes
DELETE FROM logs 
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'
LIMIT 10000;
```

### Data Validation

```sql
-- Insert with validation
INSERT INTO employees (name, email, salary)
SELECT name, email, salary
FROM temp_employees
WHERE email ~ '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$'
  AND salary > 0
  AND name IS NOT NULL;

-- Update with validation
UPDATE products 
SET price = new_price
FROM product_updates pu
WHERE products.id = pu.product_id
  AND pu.new_price > 0
  AND pu.new_price < products.price * 2; -- Prevent huge price jumps
```

## Best Practices

### Safety Practices

- Always use WHERE clause with UPDATE/DELETE
- Test with SELECT before UPDATE/DELETE
- Use transactions for related operations
- Backup data before bulk modifications

### Performance Practices

- Use appropriate indexes
- Batch operations when possible
- Use LIMIT for large operations
- Analyze query plans with EXPLAIN

### Data Integrity

- Use constraints to prevent invalid data
- Validate data before insertion
- Use transactions for consistency
- Handle NULL values appropriately

### Example Complete Operations

```sql
-- Safe employee update process
BEGIN;
    -- First, check what will be updated
    SELECT id, name, current_salary, new_salary
    FROM employees e
    JOIN salary_updates su ON e.id = su.employee_id
    WHERE su.effective_date = CURRENT_DATE;
    
    -- Perform the update
    UPDATE employees 
    SET 
        salary = su.new_salary,
        updated_at = NOW(),
        updated_by = current_user
    FROM salary_updates su
    WHERE employees.id = su.employee_id
      AND su.effective_date = CURRENT_DATE
      AND su.new_salary > 0;
      
    -- Log the changes
    INSERT INTO audit_log (table_name, operation, record_id, changed_by)
    SELECT 'employees', 'UPDATE', id, current_user
    FROM employees 
    WHERE updated_at = NOW();
    
COMMIT;
```
