# Angular @defer - Revision Notes & Interview Questions

## Revision Notes

### What is @defer?

**@defer blocks** (Deferrable views) are Angular's mechanism for **lazy loading** components, reducing initial bundle size by splitting code into separate JavaScript files that load only when needed.

**Key Benefits:** - Faster initial page load - Improved Core Web Vitals (LCP, TTFB) - Better performance for large applications - Code splitting at component level

### Basic Syntax

```
@defer {
  <large-component />
}
```

### Dependencies That Can Be Deferred

**✅ Can be deferred:** - Standalone components, directives, pipes - Component CSS styles - Transitive dependencies (even NgModule-based)

**❌ Cannot be deferred:** - Non-standalone dependencies - Components referenced outside @defer block - Components used in ViewChild queries

### Sub-blocks for State Management

#### 1. @placeholder

- Shows content **before** @defer is triggered
- Dependencies are **eagerly loaded**
- Supports minimum display time: `@placeholder (minimum 500ms)`

```
@defer {
  <large-component />
} @placeholder {
  <p>Loading placeholder...</p>
}
```

#### 2. @loading

- Shows content **while** dependencies are loading
- Replaces @placeholder once loading starts
- Two parameters: `after` and `minimum`

```
@defer {
  <large-component />
} @loading (after 100ms; minimum 1s) {
  <img src="loading.gif" alt="Loading..." />
}
```

#### 3. @error

- Shows when deferred loading **fails**
- Dependencies eagerly loaded

```
@defer {
  <large-component />
} @error {
  <p>Failed to load component</p>
}
```

### Triggers

#### 1. **on** Triggers

- `idle` (default) - Browser idle state
- `viewport` - Element enters viewport
- `interaction` - Click/keydown events
- `hover` - Mouseover/focusin events
- `immediate` - After non-deferred content renders
- `timer(duration)` - After specified time

#### 2. **when** Triggers

- Custom conditional expressions
- One-time operation (doesn't revert)

```
@defer (when showContent) {
  <large-component />
}
```

### Prefetching

Load JavaScript **before** showing content:

```
@defer (on interaction; prefetch on idle) {
  <large-component />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Click to load</div>
}
```

### SSR/SSG Behavior

- Default: Always renders @placeholder on server
- Triggers activate on client after hydration
- Use Incremental Hydration for server-side defer content

### Best Practices

- ❌ Avoid nested @defer with same triggers
- ❌ Don't defer viewport-visible components (CLS issues)
- ❌ Avoid immediate/timer triggers for initial render
- ✅ Use different triggers for nested blocks
- ✅ Consider prefetching for better UX

## 🎯 Common Interview Questions & Scenarios

### Q1: Basic Understanding

**"What is @defer in Angular and why would you use it?"**

**Answer:** @defer is Angular's lazy loading mechanism for components that reduces initial bundle size by splitting code into separate chunks. It improves Core Web Vitals like LCP and TTFB by deferring non-critical content loading until needed.

### Q2: Practical Implementation

**"How would you implement a defer block for a dashboard widget that should load when the user scrolls to it?"**

**Answer:**

```
@defer (on viewport) {
  <dashboard-widget />
} @placeholder {
  <div class="widget-skeleton">Loading widget...</div>
} @loading (minimum 300ms) {
  <spinner />
} @error {
  <div>Failed to load widget</div>
}
```

### Q3: Performance Optimization

**"A user complains that a modal takes too long to open. How could @defer help?"**

**Answer:** Use prefetching to load modal content before user interaction:

```
<button #modalTrigger>Open Modal</button>
@defer (on interaction(modalTrigger); prefetch on hover(modalTrigger)) {
  <complex-modal />
}
```

### Q4: Debugging Scenario

**"Your @defer block isn't working - the component loads immediately. What could be wrong?"**

**Common Issues:** - Component isn't standalone - Component is referenced outside @defer block - Component used in ViewChild query - Missing proper triggers

### Q5: Advanced Scenario

**"Design a product listing page where related products load after 2 seconds, but prefetch when user hovers over main product."**

**Answer:**

```
<div #mainProduct>Main Product Details</div>

@defer (on timer(2s); prefetch on hover(mainProduct)) {
  <related-products />
} @placeholder {
  <div class="related-skeleton">Related products loading...</div>
} @loading (after 100ms; minimum 500ms) {
  <loading-spinner />
}
```

### Q6: Testing Knowledge

**"How would you test different states of a @defer block?"**

**Answer:**

```
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  deferBlockBehavior: DeferBlockBehavior.Manual
});

const deferBlockFixture = (await fixture.getDeferBlocks())[0];
await deferBlockFixture.render(DeferBlockState.Loading);
await deferBlockFixture.render(DeferBlockState.Complete);
```

### Q7: Architecture Decision

**"When should you NOT use @defer?"**

**Answer:** - For above-the-fold content (causes CLS) - Small components with minimal impact - Components needed immediately for UX - When loading delay affects critical user flows

### Q8: Complex Scenario

**"You have a dashboard with 5 widgets. Some should load immediately, others on user interaction, and one should preload. How would you structure this?"**

**Answer:**

```
<!-- Critical widgets - no defer -->
<critical-widget />

<!-- Load on viewport -->
@defer (on viewport) {
  <analytics-widget />
} @placeholder {
  <widget-skeleton />
}

<!-- Load on interaction with prefetch -->
@defer (on interaction; prefetch on idle) {
  <heavy-chart-widget />
} @placeholder {
  <button>Load Charts</button>
}

<!-- Conditional loading -->
@defer (when userHasPremium) {
  <premium-widget />
}
```

### Q9: Performance Troubleshooting

**"Your app's initial load improved with @defer, but users complain about jarring content shifts. How do you fix this?"**

**Answer:** - Use skeleton placeholders with proper dimensions - Reserve space for deferred content - Avoid deferring viewport-visible components - Use `minimum` parameter to prevent flickering - Consider CSS container queries for responsive placeholders

### Q10: Integration Challenge

**"How would @defer work with Angular Universal and what considerations are there?"**

**Answer:** - Server renders @placeholder by default - Triggers activate after client hydration - Consider Incremental Hydration for server-side defer - Plan for SEO impact if deferring important content - Test both server and client rendering scenarios
